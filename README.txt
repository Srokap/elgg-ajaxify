templates.xml 
=============
templates.xml contains some javascript templates you can add to your 
Eclipse environment.  You'll need WTP 3.1. To add the templates, go to...

Window->Preferences->Web->JavaScript->Editor->Templates->Import...

To use one of these templates, type 'elgg' then Ctrl+Space.  These templates
are meant to get you coding faster and to encourage you to adhere to elgg-y
coding conventions.


jsTestDriver.conf
=================
I use jsTestDriver for testing (http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/). 
jsTestDriver.conf is my configuration file for ajaxify.  If you're working in 
Eclipse, your project root is probably your elgg root.  You should copy this
file to that directory so that you can set up the Eclipse plugin. Instructions
on other details about how to set jsTestDriver, including the Eclipse plugin,
can be found at the website above.
